# Madlib generator with Sanity, Netlify, and 11ty Serverless

This repository is a demo for this Smashing Magazine article.

It creates a madlib generator that stores madlib templates and user-generated madlibs in a Sanity content lake. It builds static and server-rendered pages with 11ty, and uses Netlify On-Demand builders and serverless functions to add interactivity.
